# Financial Intent Analyzer

This Python application uses GPT models to extract financial-related intents from text and perform sentiment analysis for detecting urgency in financial communications.

## Features

- Financial intent extraction using GPT-3.5
- Sentiment analysis for urgency detection
- Combined analysis of financial intents and urgency levels
- Support for various financial categories including:
  - Investment intent
  - Loan request
  - Payment issues
  - Account inquiries
  - Financial advice
  - Transaction requests
  - Budget planning
  - Other financial concerns

## Setup

1. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your OpenAI API key:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

## Usage

```python
from financial_intent_analyzer import FinancialIntentAnalyzer

# Initialize the analyzer
analyzer = FinancialIntentAnalyzer()

# Analyze text
text = "I need to transfer $5,000 to my savings account immediately. This is urgent as I have a payment due tomorrow."
results = analyzer.analyze_financial_text(text)

# Print results
print(results)
```

## Output Format

The analyzer returns a dictionary with two main components:

1. `financial_intents`: Contains detected financial intents, confidence scores, and relevant details
2. `urgency_analysis`: Contains sentiment analysis and urgency level assessment

## Example Output

```json
